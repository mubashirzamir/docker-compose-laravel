## This is where your Laravel app goes

To get started, **delete the contents of this folder** and then do one of the following:

- Clone your project or copy all of the files directly into this `src` directory.
- Spin up the Docker network by following the instructions on the main [README.md](../README.md), and install a brand new Laravel project by running `docker compose -f ../compose-development.yml run --rm composer create-project laravel/laravel .` in your terminal.
